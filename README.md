# ImageRecognition
This is a hybrid mobile application built in Ionic React and Capacitor. The frontend was developed in Ionic through the use of the React library, while Capacitor is used to implement the use of a camera on any given device. Using the camera, the application can determine what object is in a given photograph, in which the result can help prompt the user into making an informed purchase decision.
